My work majorly focuses on analyzing all types on omics data. I spend most of my time analysing sequencing data (RNA or ChIP). The very first step in data analysis is the quality check. Once I am assured that the data is of high quality, I move on to clustering to visualize how similar or different the samples are. All the alogrithms that I use invlove complex clustering ang data fitting methods. To get a better understanding of these concepts, I look forward to this course.
